    <p>What style of wedding is this?</p>

    <p>
      The casual and relaxed kind! We have a small guest list so it should be an
      intimate event.
    </p>

    <p>Will there be adult beverages?</p>

    <p>
      We opting to not provide alcohol, since our venue would require us to hire
      a bartender.
    </p>

    <p>Will there be a photographer?</p>

    <p>
      Yes, her name is <a href="https://www.reedefisher.com/">Reede Fisher</a>.
      Please avoid flash photography that could interfere with the professional
      photography. (We are happy to share the photos after the ceremony as well)
    </p>

    <p>Is a hotel room needed?</p>

    <p>
      Since our ceremony is in the early afternoon, we donâ€˜t think that many of
      our guests will need a hotel room but we can reach out to folks we know in
      the area for recommendations (just let us know)
    </p>

    <p>Other questions?</p>

    <p>
      Contact one of us if you have any other questions. Somebody else probably
      has the same questions!
