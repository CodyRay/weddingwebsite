The Dalles Civic Auditorium

## Landing Page

We are excited to share our special day with you! We hope that this website provides you with all the important details you need to attend our wedding. Please don't hesitate to contact us if you have any remaining questions.

If you haven't already, please RSVP to let us know that you are coming. You'll also find ceremony and reception details including directions. Check back occasionally as we will be making updates throughout the fall.

In case you haven't met one of us ;), check out the story of who we are and how we met.

Thanks again to all of our family and friends for their love and support - we will see you in November!

## Info

The wedding ceremony will start at about 2:00 PM on November 17th. After the ceremony, the reception will be held in the adjacent room. We arn't planning on holding a sitdown dinner, but there should be enough food that nobody should be hungry afterwards (don't forget to save room for cake too). Throughout the reception we plan to have some music, dancing, and socializing. We can use the venue all afternoon, but we expect things will wrap up before 6 PM at the latest.

Picture of Civic Auditorium |

We will be holding our wedding at The Dalles Civic Auditorium in The Dalles, Oregon. We choose to look for venues in the Columbia River Gorge because it is a convenient half-way point between Salem and Hermiston and we wanted to make sure that non of our guests would have a excessive drive to the wedding. We settled on the Civic Auditorium because it was indoors (November after all), wasn't overly large for the cozy ceremony we had in mind, and had separate but adjacent spaces for the reception and ceremony. The Civic Auditorium is near downtown The Dalles, and only has street side parking (so just be mindful that it may be a short walk from your car to the auditorium).

## FAQ

> What style of wedding is this?

The casual and relaxed kind! We have a small guest list so it should be an intimate event.

> Booze?

We are going to opt to not provide alcohol to save money, since our venue would require us to hire a bartender if we served any alcohol.

> Will there be a photographer?

Yep, shout out to our photographer [Reede Fisher](https://www.reedefisher.com/). She recomends guests avoid flash photography that might interfere with the profesional photography. (We are happy to share the photos after the ceremony as well)

> Is a hotel room needed?

Based on the time of our ceremony, we don't think that many of our guests will need a hotel room. However, if we are wrong about that we can reach out to folks we know in the area for recomendations (let us know :D )

> Other questions?

Contact one of us if you have any other questions. Somebody else probably has the same questions :)
